simple-web-frontend
===================

A simple PHP web frontend, created with small or embedded devices like the Raspberry Pi in mind, that shows useful information about the machine it's running on in the form of captured console commands (non-interactive). Allows to define menu entries and links to easily monitor the machine remotely without the need to log in.

Requires Apache2 and PHP to run.
